/*Task 3: Constants vs. Variables
Objective: Understand the difference between let and const.
Instructions:
Create a const variable birthYear with the year you were born (e.g., 1999).
Create a let variable currentYear with the value 2025.
Log both to the console.
Try reassigning birthYear to a new value (e.g., 2000) and see what happens.
Change currentYear to 2026 and log it again.*/

const birthYear = 1999;
let currentYear = 2020;

//birthYear = 2000; not possible if keyword os const
console.log(birthYear);
currentYear = 2026;
console.log(currentYear);
