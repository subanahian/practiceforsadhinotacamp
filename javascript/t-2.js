/*Task 2: Play with Data Types
Objective: Experiment with different data types.
Instructions:
Create three variables:
favNumber with a number (e.g., 42).
isStudent with a boolean (true or false).
hobby with a string (e.g., "gaming").
Log each variable to the console with a label, like: My favorite number is 42.
Try mixing them in one sentence, e.g., I am a student: true, I like gaming, and my number is 42.*/

var favNumber = 42;
var isStudent = false;
var hobby = "gaming";

console.log("My favorite number is " + favNumber);
console.log(
  "I am a student : " +
    isStudent +
    "," +
    " I like " +
    hobby +
    "," +
    "and my niumber is " +
    favNumber
);
